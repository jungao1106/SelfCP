       "{'source': \"Most customers at the Anthropologie store in SoHo come for the delicately woven knits and the ultrafeminine floral dresses. But these days at least some are coming for the books.Last Sunday the merchandise and books were coordinated with near-perfect precision. Resting beside a black sweater ($68) and a jet-black skirt with orange embellishments ($118) were copies of Annie Leibovitz's ''A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005,'' big and black and gleaming, for $75. A pop-up book called ''One Red Dot'' echoed a display of polka-dotted canvas sneakers, while another title, ''The Persistence of Yellow,'' perfectly matched a strategically positioned yellow knit sweater.Books are turning up in the oddest places these days.With book sales sagging -- down 2.6 percent as of August over the same period last year, according to the Association of American Publishers -- publishers are pushing their books into butcher shops, carwashes, cookware stores, cheese shops, even chi-chi clothing boutiques where high-end literary titles are used to amplify the elegant lifestyle they are attempting to project.What began as a trickle of cookbooks in kitchen shops and do-it-yourself titles in hardware stores has become, in recent months, the fastest growing component in many major publishers' retail strategies.''It's a way for the book business to stay alive,'' said Abby Hoffman, the vice president of sales and marketing for Chronicle Books  in San Francisco, which sells most of its 350 offbeat titles each year to places like high-end grocery stores, children's clothing stores and wineries. ''Anyplace that sells merchandise is a place to sell books.''When Starbucks got into the book business last month, it hitched its brand to Mitch Albom's latest inevitable best seller, ''For One More Day,'' helping propel it to the top of the lists. But the shift in the business can more clearly be seen in the sale of lower-profile authors in lower-profile settings, where the right title in the right location can make all the difference for a book that might otherwise sink without a trace.Mike's Deli in the Bronx, for instance, has sold more than 4,500 copies of Ann Volkwein's ''Arthur Avenue Cookbook'' at $25 each. That book otherwise sold only 8,000 copies nationwide, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks sales at major book chains, independent bookstores and online retailers, but not at places like Mike's. But it sold so well at Mike's that David Greco, the deli's owner, began stocking more titles, including ''The Italian American Cookbook'' by John Mariani and ''Con Amore: A Daughter-in-Law's Story of Growing Up Italian-American in Bushwick'' by Bea Tusiani.Mr. Greco says he must factor in at least one expense that bookstores don't: ''When you deal with salami and mozzarella, its a little greasy. So we keep the books in plastic bags.''After years of concentrating on big-box retailers like Borders and Barnes & Noble and online retailers like Amazon, many major publishing houses are retooling their tactics to take advantage of this new frontier.Simon & Schuster, one of the industry's largest publishers, is urging its sales representatives to punctuate their bookstore rounds with impromptu pitches at promising shops and markets they spot in their travels. The Time Warner Book Group routinely changes the color or design of book jackets at a store's request so the book will color-coordinate with merchandise. And HarperCollins plans to design books for its spring catalog in shades of ''margarita and sangria,'' greens and reds that store owners have told the publisher will dominate that season's color palette, said Andrea Rosen, vice president for special markets.At Penguin Group, sales representatives have begun pushing into rural areas that are short on big bookstores, selling at cattle auctions, among other places.The total number of books sold outside bookstores is impossible to discern. BookScan's sales figures typically account for 60 percent to 70 percent of a book's sales, but those figures do not include copies sold in nontraditional places.Nonetheless, publishing houses know how it has affected their bottom line.In the last four years Simon & Schuster's special market sales, as they are called, have grown by 50 percent, surpassing total sales to independent bookstores, said Jack Romanos, the publishing house's president and chief executive.''The publisher now has a responsibility to put books in front of more eyeballs,'' Mr. Romanos said. ''The market was always there, but I don't know that most publishers were as aggressive about trying to develop it 10 years ago as they are today.''Some placements make intuitive sense: publishers sell a baby book to a specialty store like Buy Buy Baby; cookbooks go to Williams-Sonoma and other cookware outlets; glossy fashion books to clothing boutiques; design books to stores like Restoration Hardware. But some matches may not be so obvious. Even Bath & Body Works, at Westfield Garden State Plaza in Paramus, N.J., for instance, sells a half-dozen titles on subjects including weddings, gardening and travel to Provence.With the proper placement, a book displayed at a national chain like Urban Outfitters can easily sell more there than at any other retailer, including blockbuster stores like Barnes & Noble. A recent article in Publishers Weekly noted that one surprise fall hit, ''Wall and Piece,'' written by the graffiti artist Banksy and published by the Century imprint of Random House in Britain, saw its biggest sales at Urban Outfitters and independent bookstores.The point, publishers say, is to follow customers who might not otherwise visit bookstores into the places where they do shop, rather than waiting for customers to show up at bookstores or click on Amazon.com and other online sales sites.People who buy books at farm-supply stores, for instance, are a prime potential market because there may be no bookstores in their rural communities, said Barbara O'Shea, president of nontrade sales for Penguin. ''There is nobody selling books, so we've gotten these places to sell books,'' she said.The phenomenon is an urban and suburban one, as well.Martin & Osa, a new clothing retailer aimed at 25-to-40-year-olds, stocks dozens of titles in its four stores and is planning to add more, including a ''reading list'' of graphic novels, fiction and nonfiction for customers. ''We try to offer them things that aren't mainstream, more unusual, more unique,'' said Arnie Cohen, the chief marketing officer.At Anthropologie on Sunday, Ruth Rennert lounged among the throw pillows on a mustard-yellow sofa -- not far from that display of yellow sweaters and books -- leafing through ''Jackie: A Life in Pictures,'' about the former first lady. Shopping for books in a setting like this, she said, is preferable to enduring the hustle and bustle of big bookstores.While the bulk of books sold in some of these places are novelty titles -- like ''Bruce Aidells's Complete Book of Pork'' from HarperCollins, now in hundreds of butcher shops -- in recent months a broader list of titles has also begun to emerge.Al Gore's ''An Inconvenient Truth'' is for sale at Urban Outfitters, for instance. Staples, the office-supply chain, began carrying business books several years ago, but more recently has added titles like ''Your Best Life Now: 7 Steps to Living at Your Full Potential,'' by Joel Osteen.And publishers have stumbled on advantages that often come with this territory: outside of a bookstore, a title enjoys less competition, a more inviting display space and the store's implicit stamp of approval.''You walk into Restoration Hardware and you want the couch and the vase and the nightstand, and then you want the two books that are on the nightstand,'' Ms. Rosen said. ''The books complete the story.''MEDIA\",\n",

       " 'similarText0': \"''Love Potion No. 9'' is music you can dance to, but could an old rock-and-roll beat drive a memoir into a best seller for the songsmith Jerry Leiber? For such nagging literary questions, the publishing house of Grove Press turned to Barnes & Noble, the nation's largest chain of bookstores.Back came a tepid response to a manuscript written by Mr. Leiber, the creator of ''Love Potion'': a tentative order of 1,200 copies. Suddenly, Grove Press was no longer in the mood to rock, or to roll out a book by Mr. Leiber.Unsettled by flagging sales and heavy book returns, publishing executives in search of oracles have begun turning to the dominant chains like Barnes & Noble and Borders for guidance about a broad range of issues -- from dust jacket colors and punchy titles, to authors' precise sales histories and forecasts of customer demand -- that could determine a manuscript's destiny.They are nurturing their ties with techniques straight from the books on relationships stacked on the self-help shelves -- sharing, listening and communicating.''We're much closer,'' said Harold Evans, publisher and president of Random House, the leading publisher of adult hard-cover books in the United States. ''I think all of us recognize the common interest that we have. It isn't a sacrifice of our individuality or an imposition on their time. It's necessary to cope with a marketplace that has changed so dramatically.''But this new coziness is raising alarm among critics who are wary that the few large national chains could ultimately dictate production and packaging in the literary marketplace as, say, the mass merchant Wal-Mart does with its toothpaste and pretzel suppliers.''This is intellectual property, which is a whole different kettle of fish,'' said Margaret Maupin, a buyer for 13 years at the Tattered Cover, an independent store in Denver where she still works the  sales floor. ''And it's really bad when a publisher is allowed to make a decision based on a few people's tastes,'' she said. ''It's heart stopping.''Publishers have long made commercial decisions about the marketing of books, of course.  But the increasing reliance on the advice of a few big retailers and their computers is a far cry from the rumpled-cardigan, reading-glasses style by which publishers used to gauge the literary market.In the pre-superstore era, sales representatives for the publishers sampled the tastes of the reading public by traveling to hundreds of bookstores like the Tattered Cover to meet buyers like Ms. Maupin. But, increasingly, those visits are not as critical as consultations with several dozen book buyers for the national chains who work in corporate headquarters -- far removed from the book stacks but with quick access to computer data bases.For critics, the worst fear is that literary expression could be homogenized by a small, number-crunching, information-sharing elite.Yet publishers, who insist they are consulting independents as well as chains, say they are using the information as informal market research to prevent costly flops in the current bleak business climate. Net sales for adult trade books have plunged more than 12 percent so far this year, and almost 45 percent are returned to publishers unsold.Most recently, those trends prompted HarperCollins to prune its book lists and cancel more than 100 existing book contracts to make its house more efficient. By seeking advice from the chains, other publishers are also looking for creative ways to reduce expenses.''The whole industry is suffering from higher returns, so you want to find out what's happening,'' Mr. Evans said. ''If a bookstore takes 10 books and then sends back 5, it's a terrible business.''No wonder, then, that when Random House was dissatisfied with a dust jacket for ''The Last Don,'' the comeback novel of the best-selling author Mario Puzo, executives sought an outside critique of the cover. With advice from a Barnes & Noble buyer, the cover evolved from black to crimson with bolder type.They also sought suggestions from the chains in preparation for the publication of ''Credo,'' a book by Melvyn Bragg, a best-selling author from Britain. With feedback from the booksellers, Mr. Evans said, Random House changed not only the dust jacket but also the title. ''Credo'' became ''The Sword and the Miracle.''Mr. Evans said Random House also turned to the buyers while deciding whether to buy a first novel from a British author for publication in the United States. ''We thought it was British in sensibility, but we thought it was so good it might override it,'' he said. ''They reinforced our doubts. We didn't buy it.''Len Riggio, chief executive of the 453-unit Barnes & Noble chain, scoffs at the idea of a growing warmth in his company's relationships with major publishers.''I absolutely disagree that there's been a change,'' Mr. Riggio said. ''I'm saying that it always was pretty good. There has always been close cooperation between us and publishers in terms of sharing information and knowledge. We're not publishers. They originate the ideas.''But during a private teleconference with Wall Street analysts about the company's quarterly financial earnings in March, Mr. Riggio ranked publisher relations as one crucial element of his business -- and increasingly so.''We think our relationship with publishers is getting better every day,'' Mr. Riggio told the analysts. ''Working with the publishers and having better systems to decrease the return rate will increase our margins.''The evolution of the relationship between publishers and the major book-selling chains reflects the dynamics of an industry now dominated by the chains.As late as 1991, independent bookstores made up the largest slice of the market -- more than 32 percent -- while the large chains accounted for 22 percent, according to the publisher-supported Book Industry Study Group. By last year, the chains held the biggest share -- 26 percent. And the independent bookstores had slipped to third place, with 18.6 percent, surpassed by a new, eclectic mass-market category of food and drug stores and price clubs, which have increased their share to almost 20 percent.''Barnes & Noble and Borders have an increasing presence, so we really must spend more time with them to get our books across to a wider audience,'' said Ira Silverberg, Grove Press's editor in chief, who decided not to publish Mr. Leiber's memoir.In this rapidly changing literary market, where failed books are simply returned to publishers for pulp, titles have a shelf life ''somewhere between radicchio and active culture yogurt'' -- as the Book Industry Study Group said in its most recent annual report.When books started flooding back, ''the publishers almost started developing an inferiority complex -- are we publishing the right titles?'' said Robert B. Teicher, a longtime fiction buyer for Borders, which is based in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''And they had some self-doubts for all their hype. And so they have come to us: 'How do you see it? And what do we need to do differently?' And we've offered ideas, not specific titles, but formats.''''They never ask us whether they should publish a book or not,'' Mr. Teicher added. ''It's more, 'Did you read the manuscript and how much would you buy?' I think they have key accounts that they look to for barometers.''Traditionally, it has been the publishers' sales representatives who shuttle between the buyers and their houses, promoting books and collecting feedback about coming titles.The chains are being treated as sages, in part because they possess a ready base of computerized information about national sales and trends that can take weeks for a publisher to piece together. No national sales tracking system includes the independents, but the creators of Soundscan -- which gathers record industry sales information -- is approaching major publishers to establish a similar system that would compile cash-register information from a much broader sampling of bookstores.Not surprisingly, literary agents complain that risk-averse publishers are addicted to such information.''If a store orders 20 copies of author X and sells 10, the next time they order 10,'' said David Black, a Manhattan literary agent. ''You realize that no decision is made on the quality of the work. The author is getting better, and the second book should have more value, but that's not the way they look at it. It becomes a self-defeating prophecy.''But for publishers, especially small presses without the resources to monitor the market, consultation with big chains is simply efficient.Consider Dalkey Archive Press, a nonprofit literary house based in Normal, Ill. John O'Brien, Dalkey's publisher, notes that in the last five years his sales through Borders and Barnes & Noble have steadily increased.Several times, he said, his house has reissued out-of-print books at the suggestions of chain buyers who thought the time was ripe to reintroduce particular authors. And just this month, Mr. O'Brien traveled to the Borders Ann Arbor headquarters seeking advice and bearing dust jackets for critiques.In one case, Mr. O'Brien said he was urged to reconsider a dust jacket with geometrical patterns and numbers that gave the book the feel of a physics textbook. Mr. O'Brien took the cover back to his artist for a redesign.Four Walls Eight Windows, an independent press in Manhattan, changed the cover for Amir D. Aczel's detective story of the intellect, a tale of how a Princeton professor recently solved a three-century-old mathematical problem, ''Fermat's Last Theorem.''The original cover featured a crinkled piece of paper with a hurried scribble of a small circle pierced by two rays. A buyer from Barnes & Noble ''didn't like it and said you've got to have the guy's face on the cover,'' said John Oakes, Four Walls' publisher. ''And I said fine. It wasn't an outrageous suggestion, and there's no question that they could affect the book's life.''But Mr. Oakes and other publishers say that the big chains' guidance is only that -- advice, which the houses will ignore when convinced that their own ideas are better.Atlantic Monthly's book-publishing unit, for instance, decided this year to stick with its original cover for the novel ''Cold Mountain,'' a spare landscape scene in blue and black that evoked the Civil War-era Southern scenery described by Charles Frazier, a first-time author.Barnes & Noble suggested a more literal Civil War image to attract the attention of history buffs, said Kim Wylie, the sales representative for Atlantic.''We couldn't find anything that wasn't overtly warlike,'' Ms. Wylie said.So Atlantic Monthly kept its dreamy landscape. And somehow ''Cold Mountain'' still managed to achieve storybook success for its first-time author. It rose to No. 3 on the New York Times best-seller list.\",\n",

       " 'similarText1': \"Forget about agents and auctions and multimillion-dollar contracts. The stiffest competition in the book business may be among the many publishers staking claim to Dickens, Austen, Herodotus and Plato.Selling the classics is one of the few areas of significant growth in an otherwise stagnant business. Major publishers, including Penguin Group USA and Bertelsmann, are aggressively defending their lucrative share of both the consumer and academic markets by investing heavily in redesigning and expanding their classics lists.Imprints like Penguin Classics, the market leader, as well as Modern Library and Bantam Classics, two units of Bertelsmann, depend heavily on literary works in the public domain. In a very competitive market, where one copy of ''Pride and Prejudice'' can seem the same as any other, they vie not only with one another but with Barnes & Noble, which sells its own editions of classics and displays them at the front of its stores.Last month, Penguin Classics began a $500,000 promotion to kick off a two-year global program under which its entire 1,300-book list of classics, the industry's largest, will receive a complete facelift.''Penguin Classics has always been a sizable percentage of our business,'' said Kathryn Court, president of Penguin Books, a unit of Pearson. ''We determined in the last couple of years to reinforce our brand identity.'' Ms. Court would not provide sales figures but said 2002 revenue for Penguin Classics was 13 percent higher than in 2001.Sales of the classics have risen, retailers say, because of reading groups and an aging population. Increasingly, many editions include reading group guides.''I hate to bring the boomers into every discussion, but a lot more adults are going back to the classics because of reading groups,'' said Bob Gray, bookseller and buyer at Northshire Books in Vermont. ''In the last couple of years it seems like the classics went from being an afterthought to being news.''''People shopping the classics have been seeing the same books for what may be their entire lives,'' Mr. Gray added. Because of Penguin's redesign, he said, ''Now their eyes will no longer glaze over; it will probably make them stop.''For the first time, Penguin will also publish many modern classics, by John Steinbeck, Jack Kerouac and others, under the Penguin Classics imprint, discontinuing its Twentieth-Century Classics line.''Three types of Penguin books are now one type of book,'' said Penguin's marketing director, John Fagan. ''Moving to one spine increases the presence of the line visually.''The stakes are getting higher. In 2000, Modern Library introduced a series of paperback classics that many in the industry saw as an attempt to chip away at Penguin's dominance. But the bigger threat may be Barnes & Noble's editions.''B&N classics -- that's where Penguin is probably feeling the pressure,'' said an executive who insisted on anonymity. Barnes & Noble would not comment on its publishing program, but Bob Weitrak, the retailer's director of merchandising, said: ''We've always carried Penguin Classics. They are extremely good sellers.'' Many larger Barnes & Noble stores, he noted, have display areas dedicated to Penguin.With classics, said Irwyn Applebaum, president and publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, ''there is usually no royalty, the returns tend to be modest, and though price is comparatively low, the profit, on a percentage basis, not dollars, is greater than with most books.''Penguin's edition of ''Pride and Prejudice'' sold over 17,000 copies in 2002, according to Nielsen Bookscan, whose data represents about 70 percent of sales but does not include academic sales. The new Penguin edition has sold nearly 4,500 copies in a month.There are about a dozen other paperback and inexpensive hardcover editions of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' which sold more than 110,000 copies in 2002, according to Nielsen Bookscan (this does not include Barnes & Noble's editions because that retailer does not report sales of these books).Cheaper editions of classics are more likely to be assigned in high schools. Trade paperbacks, from Penguin, Oxford University Press and other academic imprints, with introductions by scholars, have more notes and are more likely to be assigned at universities. Modern Library has introductions from popular writers ''who can write intelligently for the classroom,'' said David Ebershoff, its publishing director. The Modern Library edition of ''Pride and Prejudice,'' for example, has an introduction by Anna Quindlen. Bertelsmann also publishes classics in its Everyman Library imprint.''There is no question Penguin is the market leader,'' said Ellen Chodosh, vice president and publisher of the OUP trade division, who estimated that Penguin controlled about 70 percent of the trade paperback classics market.The paperback Oxford World's Classics, from Oxford University Press, appeared in 1980. ''When we first started, stores would only stock titles that Penguin didn't publish,'' Ms. Chodosh said. World's Classics accounts for about 20 percent of Oxford's total paperback revenue, and sales for the series have ''grown consistently,'' though they ''flattened a little last year,'' she said.It is ''difficult to compete with Penguin at the retail level,'' Ms. Chodosh said, ''especially as stores are reducing the shelf space given to multiple copies.''Oxford, like Penguin and increasingly Modern Library, aggressively promotes itself in the academic market. Oxford publishes about 800 titles. Modern Library publishes about 300.Mr. Ebershoff said that Modern Library paperbacks, which were introduced with 36 titles two years ago, have become profitable quickly. ''There wasn't much I could do with the hardcover business because that wasn't going to take us back to the classroom,'' he said. ''And that is the heart of the classics business.''The biggest change has come not from competitors but from Congress. The 1998 Copyright Extension Act sharply limited the works that were scheduled to fall into the public domain. The legislation ensured publishers' continuing exclusive rights to seminal works of modern literature like ''The Great Gatsby'' and ''Mrs. Dalloway,'' both first published in 1925.F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby,'' published in paperback by Simon & Schuster, sold 500,000 copies in 2002, figures that would have helped rivals' bottom line, even divided many ways. Virginia Woolf's ''Mrs. Dalloway,'' published by Harcourt, was the inspiration for the novel ''The Hours,'' by Michael Cunningham, and with the success of the film version of ''The Hours,'' sales of ''Mrs. Dalloway'' have risen sharply. Last year, it sold 53,000 copies in paperback. Since Jan. 1, it has sold about 85,000.''The first thing you'd do in classics publishing was keep a list -- a rolling schedule of what was going into the public domain,'' Mr. Ebershoff said. ''That was item No. 1. Now it's not only not item No. 1; it's not an item.''MEDIA\",\n",

In 2000, the No. 1 title was ''The Brethren'' by John Grisham and it sold 2,875,000 copies, an increase of more than 1,000 percent.More book titles than ever are being published these days, an estimated 114,487 in 2001, compared with 39,000 in 1975, and more people are buying them, according to a new survey of a quarter-century of publishing by Gayle Feldman, a contributing editor at Publishers Weekly and a 2001-2002 fellow at Columbia University's National Arts Journalism Program.So why do publishers complain?Well, one reason, Ms. Feldman said on Wednesday evening, is that with so many books being published, ''it makes it harder for most books to receive any attention.'' Ms. Feldman spoke, and presented her survey, ''Best and Worst of Times: The Changing Business of Trade Books, 1975-2002,'' at a panel discussion sponsored by the National Arts Journalism Program at Columbia University.The panel included a publisher, a book editor, a bookseller and Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly, who compiles the magazine's best-seller lists.Ms. Feldman cited many of the well-known reasons for the long-term boom in book sales. Chain stores like Barnes & Noble and online booksellers like Amazon.com have contributed to the increase, as have the huge promotion budgets for a few books that have made some writers celebrities.Another factor -- attributed in Ms. Feldman's report to Carolyn K. Reidy, president of adult publishing at Simon & Schuster -- is that ''literature and reading became part of the boomer self-definition.''Ms. Feldman said publishers' biggest complaints included the financial pressures that have come with Wall Street-oriented consolidations. In the past, publishers expected a profit of 10 or 12 percent, she said, but now they are expected to come closer to 20 percent profits.Other complaints from the literary side concern the growing power of marketing people and the weight put on the computerized tracking of sales figures, which affect authors' future advances.Publishers experienced flat sales this fall before Thanksgiving, and ''there was real cause for concern,'' said Lorraine Shanley, a principal of Market Partners International, a consulting firm. But she said that since then, sales have begun to rise again.Ms. Feldman also said that even though publishers had announced cuts in their lists in response to financial pressures, the sales numbers were creeping up again.The survey found better sales for best sellers. Before 1985, only two novels and no nonfiction books had sold more than one million copies during their publication year. Today, one million books sold in the first year is expected for some best sellers.Some results of Ms. Feldman's survey were surprising. Even though people often believe that commercial fiction does not last, she said, best-selling fiction actually stays in print longer than best-selling nonfiction. And while winning a prize can help sales for unknown fiction writers, prizes have little effect for established authors.The best-selling types of nonfiction books are largely the same today as in 1975: religious, business, self-help, personal success and beauty books, celebrity autobiographies and books with television tie-ins.Publishers' complaints also have roots in the past, Ms. Feldman said. In 1945, Max Schuster, the co-founder of Simon & Schuster, was quoted in an issue of Publishers Weekly as saying that American literature was being ''processed, stylized, syndicated, serialized, Hollywoodized, networked, televisioned, merged and high-pressured.''But Ms. Feldman's report and the panelists could not help being a little optimistic. Though midlist books may be getting little attention, there are still more being published, the report said. Larry Ashmead, a HarperCollins editor on the panel, said some good books always broke through, despite little promotion. Take ''The Professor and the Madman,'' by Simon Winchester, about the compilation of the Oxford English Dictionary. ''We spent practically nothing,'' Mr. Ashmead said. ''Yet we sold 300,000 books.'' Still, he added, ''Now it is mostly not the better books on the best-seller lists.''But Roxanne Coady, owner of R. J. Julia Booksellers in Madison, Conn., disagreed. ''My experience is there are very good books on the best-seller list,'' she said. She said the fastest-growing category in her store was fiction for young adults, exclusive of sales of Harry Potter books.Michael Pietsch, the publisher of Little, Brown, talked about the success of ''The Lovely Bones'' by Alice Sebold, a literary novel published by Little, Brown that is a surprise best seller with some 1.9 million copies in print. ''It's getting easier to get people to try first-time, early career novelists,'' he said.Ms. Maryles of Publishers Weekly was especially sanguine about the rise of trade paperbacks, independent and university publishers, and good books that ''make the independent and regional lists.''Yesterday, Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House, which posted a profit for the last six months of 2001 but has also ordered layoffs, said that although he had not seen Ms. Feldman's report, the company was ''very bullish about the future.'' He added, ''We are investing in author development and marketing support and technology very aggressively.''At the end of her report, Ms. Feldman summed up the outlook. In book publishing, she writes, ''it's always, as Dickens would have it, the best and worst of times.''Correction:  December 7, 2002, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about the state of the book publishing market misstated the recent period for which Random House reported a profit. It was the first half of this year, not the last half of 2001.\",\n",

       " 'summary': 'Morris Dees was co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) in 1971 and has served as its Chief Trial Counsel and Executive Director.  The SPLC participates in tracking down hate groups and publicizing their activities in its Intelligence Report, teaching tolerance and bringing lawsuits against discriminatory practices and hate groups.  As early as 1973 the SPLC won a federal case which forced funeral homes throughout the U.S. to provide equal services to blacks and whites.  In 1991 it started a classroom program \"Teaching Tolerance\" which features books, videos, posters and a magazine that goes to more than 400,000 teachers.  It also funded a civil rights litigation program in Georgia to provide free legal assistance to poor people.  The SPLC\\'s most outstanding successes, however, have been in its civil lawsuits against hate groups.  Dees and the SPLC have fought to break the organizations by legal action resulting in severe financial penalties.  Described as \"wielding the civil lawsuit like a Buck Knife, carving financial assets out of hate group leaders,\" the technique has been most impressive: 1987-$7 million against the United Klans of America in Mobile, Alabama; 1989-$1 million against Klan groups in Forsyth County, Georgia; 1990-$9 million against the White Aryan Resistance in Portland, Oregon; and 1998-$20 million against The Christian Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in Charleston, South Carolina.  But despite these judgments the Ku Klux Klan and White Aryan Resistance have survived. ',\n",

GERANIOS\\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A lawyer who specializes in\\nbankrupting hate groups is going after the Aryan Nations, whose\\ncompound in the Idaho woods has served as a clubhouse for some of\\nAmerica's most violent racists.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of\\nthe Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son\\nwho were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist\\ngroup. The victims are suing the Aryan Nations and founder Richard\\nButler.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''Put them out of business, that's what we try to do,'' Dees\\nsaid when the lawsuit was filed last year. He has declined\\nadditional comment.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler said the lawsuit was brought by enemies of the white\\nrace.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''That's the way it is for the white man today,'' Butler, 82,\\nsaid Wednesday. ''I think it's a rape of the American justice\\nsystem.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The case has its origins on July 1, 1998, when Victoria Keenan,\\n43, and her son Jason, 20, were driving on a country road near\\nHayden Lake. Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations'\\n20-acre compound.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a\\ngunshot, piled into a truck and chased the Keenans, who are part\\nwhite, part American Indian, for two miles. They fired five bullets\\ninto the Keenan car and forced it off the road. Both Keenans were\\npunched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Two of the guards were convicted of assault and are in prison. A\\nthird remains a fugitive.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Keenans are alleging assault, false imprisonment and\\nemotional distress at the hands of the guards, who they contend\\nwere agents of the Aryan Nations. They are seeking an unspecified\\namount in compensatory and punitive damages.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler and his attorney Edgar Steele are expected to argue that\\nhe should not be held liable for the actions of the volunteer\\nsecurity guards. Steele did not return a call.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In court documents, Steele described the security guards as\\n''borderline derelicts'' who were not under Butler's control.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler's beliefs should not be used against him, the defense\\ndocuments said, ''Demonizing Jews is still legal under the First\\nAmendment.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate\\ngroups. In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has\\nnever lost.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan\\norganization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,\\nAla., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building. In\\n1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan\\nResistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi\\nskinheads.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Portland case is similar to the Keenan lawsuit, in that Dees\\nargued that White Aryan Resistance founders Tom and John Metzger\\nincited the skinheads to commit murder.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dees has received death threats in the past, so the Southern\\nPoverty Law Center will have its own security force to augment the\\ntight security promised by Kootenai County authorities.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler is pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which\\nholds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the\\noffspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are\\ninferior. He presides over weekly services in a chapel where an\\nIsraeli flag is used as a doormat.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Over the years, his disciples have included some of the most\\nnotorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert\\nMathews, Randy Weaver and Buford Furrow, a former security guard at\\nthe Aryan Nations compound who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on\\ncharges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up\\na Jewish day care center last summer.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler, however, has been largely able to escape jail time. In\\n1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a\\nplot to overthrow the government.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the\\nwhite supremacist movement.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a\\nsign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his\\nliterature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan\\nWorld Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100\\nacolytes. The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's\\nbirthday.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler said the possible loss of his home ''bothers me a little\\nbit.'' He is appealing for defense funds from neo-Nazi\\nsympathizers, writing on his Web site: ''We must not let the\\nenemies of our race win this round.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Six distributors of skinhead music are donating proceeds from\\nthe sale of CDs with titles like ''Too White for You,'' and\\n''Holocaust 2000.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Vincent Bertollini, a wealthy former computer executive who\\nlives in nearby Sandpoint, Idaho, sent a mailing to thousands of\\nIdaho households last week attacking Dees as an ''anti-white, Jew\\nsupremacist.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''Just think about it,'' Bertollini's mailing said. ''A Jew team\\nof lawyers trying to destroy a white Christian church.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dees is not Jewish.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Opponents of the Aryan Nations are looking forward to seeing the\\ngroup punished.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Bill Wassmuth, whose Coeur d'Alene home was once bombed by white\\nsupremacists, said it is important to hold leaders of hate groups\\nresponsible for the actions of their followers.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''Will a successful outcome eliminate hate groups in the\\nNorthwest?

By JO THOMAS   \\n c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   \\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Morris S. Dees Jr., who has won a series\\nof civil rights suits against the Ku Klux Klan and other racist\\ngroups in a campaign to put them out of business, came to court\\nhere Monday to try to seize the Aryan Nations compound that has\\nnurtured white supremacists for more than 20 years.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law\\nCenter, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son,\\nboth white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July\\n1998. The idea is that a large judgment will force the Aryan\\nNations to turn over the compound to the plaintiffs in payment.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The suit contends that not only the guards but also the Aryan\\nNations, its 82-year-old founder, Richard Girnt Butler, and his\\nsecond in command, Michael Teague, should be held liable, on the\\nground that they run their security force in a negligent manner and\\nencourage violence.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At the time of the assault, the guards said later, they thought\\nthey were under armed attack by militant Jews. And in response to\\nthe suit's accusation that he encourages violence, lawyers for\\nButler maintain in court documents that ``demonizing Jews is still\\nlegal under the First Amendment.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``It is still legal in this country to be a bigot,'' the defense\\nsays. ``It is still legal to hate. Pastor Butler quite properly\\nerects the twin defenses of both free speech and religion contained\\nwithin the First Amendment.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Two of the security guards, who pleaded guilty to criminal\\ncharges in the assault and are now in prison, are expected to be\\ncalled as witnesses for the plaintiffs. A third guard is a fugitive\\nin the criminal case.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Jury selection began Monday morning in the Kootenai County\\nCourthouse as members of a special police weapons unit patrolled\\nthe roof and the grounds and a sole Aryan Nations supporter marched\\non the sidewalk nearby, waving the group's black and red flag.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son Jason, now\\n21, told the police that they were driving home to the nearby town\\nof Sand Point from her niece's wedding at dusk on July 1, 1998,\\nplaying music and having a good time.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Keenan said that her son had been in the Job Corps and that he\\nthrew his Job Corps card out the window on a whim and,\\ninadvertently, his wallet along with it. The wallet had been a gift\\nfrom his grandfather, she said, so she turned her car around and\\ndrove back to look for it. Her son got out with a flashlight and\\nquickly found the wallet, she said, and that is when she realized\\nthat they were near the entrance to the Aryan Nations compound, in\\nthe community of Hayden Lake.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Keenan testified at a hearing that when she turned around, her\\n1977 Datsun had backfired, as it often did. Inside the compound,\\nShane Wright, an Aryan Nations security guard, thought he heard a\\ngunshot. Seeing a car parked on the road, he and Jesse Warfield,\\nthen head of security, jumped into a pickup and began driving down\\nthe compound's long driveway. John Yeager, a skinhead from\\nCalifornia, leaped into the back of the pickup, armed with a\\nsemiautomatic rifle. The Keenans fled, with the guards _ three or\\nmore in all _ pursuing them.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Yeager, Keenan told the police, fired five rounds from an\\nassault rifle as the guards bore down on her car, screaming for her\\nto pull over. When a bullet flattened the Keenans' rear tire, their\\ncar slid into a ditch. Their pursuers ran up to them.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Keenan said a man, later identified as Warfield, struck her with\\na rifle butt, grabbed her by the hair and screamed at her. Other\\nmen tried to pull her weeping son out of the car, she said,\\nstriking him with a bat and the butt of a rifle.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   A gun ``was pointed at me,'' Keenan told the authorities. ``It\\nmade me very scared. I thought I was going to die.'' She begged\\nthem to leave her son alone. After determining that the Keenans\\nwere unarmed, the men relented, explaining that they were doing so\\nbecause both were white, she said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Witnesses are expected to testify that as a result of the\\nassault, Keenan and her son suffer from post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder, depression and anxiety.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In court documents, Edgar J. Steele, a lawyer representing\\nButler, Teague and the Aryan Nations, pointed out that on the night\\nof the attack, the volunteer guards made no effort to notify Butler\\nof their actions. ``Wright, Yeager and Warfield were way out of\\nbounds, and they knew it,'' Steele argued. ``One can only do so\\nmuch.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   He said Dees and his legal team were trying ``to paint this\\nragtag band of borderline derelicts as a highly organized,\\nwell-trained and disciplined military organization.'' That, he\\nsaid, would be ``laughable if not so patently preposterous.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In the 27 years since he moved to northern Idaho from\\nCalifornia, Butler and his organization have welcomed many white\\nsupremacists later convicted of violent crimes.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   One of the best known, and a model for the Oklahoma City bomber\\nTimothy J. McVeigh, was Robert Mathews, who in 1983 formed a\\nterrorist group known as the Order. Mathews and members of his gang\\nrobbed armored cars, bombed a synagogue in Boise and assassinated\\nAlan Berg, a Jewish talk-show host in Denver. Mathews died in a\\nsiege by the FBI in 1984, and other members of the organization are\\nserving federal prison sentences of 40 to 100 years.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler himself and 12 other white supremacist leaders were\\narrested in 1987 on federal sedition charges but were acquitted at\\ntrial in Fort Smith, Ark.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Mark Thomas, the leader of the Aryan Nations in Pennsylvania,\\nconfessed to being part of another terrorist group, the Aryan\\nRepublican Army, that in the mid-1990s robbed 22 Midwestern banks\\nin an effort to finance a white supremacist revolution.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has\\ntaken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting\\nwith a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in\\n1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur,\\nAla.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of\\nMichael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of\\nthe United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala.

Times News Service    \\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights\\norganizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest\\nwhite-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a\\nstate jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan\\nNations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two\\nyears ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's\\ncompound near here.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of\\nthe Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were\\nordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the\\nnine-woman, three-man jury.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The findings, delivered late Thursday afternoon in the Kootenai\\nCounty Courthouse, prompted tearful hugs among the plaintiffs, a\\nmother and son who were beaten and shot at in the attack, and their\\nlawyers. The defendants responded defiantly outside the courthouse,\\neven as protesters shouted at them to stop their ``message of\\nhate.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The verdict was obtained by lawyers for the Southern Poverty Law\\nCenter, a nonprofit organization in Birmingham, Ala., that has\\nsuccessfully sued the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Morris S. Dees Jr., a founder of the center, hailed the jury's\\nfinding as a powerful message against racial intolerance and one\\nthat could force the group out of its 19-acre property. ``We intend\\nto take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and\\nforever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was\\nannounced. ``We intend to even take the name Aryan Nations and\\nhopefully, through the judicial pro- cess, close a sad chapter in\\nthis na- tion's history.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The jury found that Butler and the Aryan Nations were liable for\\n$4.8 million and Teague was lia- ble for $600,000. The guards were\\nliable for most of the remaining amount.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The multimillion-dollar award also represented the kind of\\nmessage from the community that many civic leaders here had openly\\nsought, hoping that it might help the area to shed what they called\\nNorth Idaho's distorted image as a haven for people with racist\\nviews.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But Butler scoffed at the verdict, variously comparing himself\\nto figures in the Bible and to signers of the Declaration of\\nIndependence who were harassed for their views. ``This is\\nnothing,'' he said, after the verdict. ``We have planted seeds.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Said Teague: ``The message doesn't take a lot of money. We will\\nspread the message.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   A lawyer for the group said an appeal was planned.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The extent of group's assets re- mained unclear, raising\\nquestions about whether Butler and his followers, whose numbers\\nhave been described by the local authorities as dwindling, would\\npay anything close to the full amount if the award is upheld.\\nNonetheless, Dees vowed that it was the beginning of the end for\\nthe group and that the verdict was a rebuke of the Aryan Nations\\n &UR; -------------------- &LR;  leaders, who were technically found to be\\nnegligent in the training and supervision of the security guards\\nwho carried out the attack.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now\\n21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the\\nAryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12\\nmillion in compensatory and punitive damages.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But the larger purpose of the lawsuit was to bankrupt the Aryan\\nNations compound, limit Butler's ability to spread a gospel of\\nracial hate and persuade the jury to ``return a verdict that will\\nbe heard all over this nation,'' a lawyer for the Keenans, Dees\\nsaid in closing arguments.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler's lawyer, Edgar Steele, argued throughout the six-day\\ntrial that however offensive jurors might find the views of Butler,\\nhe should not be held responsible for the actions of a group of\\ndrunken young men.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Steele said the Aryan Nations property was not the incubator of\\nviolence that Dees had portrayed it to be.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``What goes on at Pastor Butler's property,'' he told the\\njurors, ``is really more akin to a homeless shelter for exceedingly\\npolitically incorrect misfits, malcontents, borderline derelicts\\nand all manner of people that drift in and out.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Keenan and her son were attacked after stopping their car near\\nthe entrance to the 19-acre Aryan Nations property near Hayden\\nLake, about 20 miles north of here, on their way home from a\\nwedding. They were looking for a wallet that Keenan had\\naccidentally dropped from their 1977 Datsun. He had been in the Job\\nCorps and had thrown his Job Corps card out the window on a whim\\nand, inadvertently, his wallet along with it. He quickly retrieved\\nthe wallet, but when the car started, it backfired, Keenan told the\\npolice after the incident.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At the compound, three guards, one of whom later told the police\\nthat he had thought the place was about to be attacked by militant\\nJews, picked up their guns, jumped in a pickup truck and chased the\\ncar. They shot at the car, flattening a rear tire and forcing the\\ncar into a ditch.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In tearful testimony, Keenan said one guard, Jesse Warfield, 45,\\nstruck her with the butt of a rifle, grabbed her by the hair and\\nscreamed at her. She and her son testified that they thought they\\nwere going to be killed.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Keenan said that she begged the men not to kill her son and that\\none of the guards then asked her if she was Indian. She testified\\nthat while she is part Cherokee, she told the men, ``No, I'm a poor\\nwhite farm girl.'' A guard then said that because they were white,\\nthe men would let them go.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At the trial, another security guard, John Yeager, 21, testified\\nthat he was too drunk that night to remember whether he or the\\nother men had fired at the Keenans. Under questioning, Yeager read\\nportions of a letter from jail in which he expressed his allegiance\\nto Butler, saying, ``Next to Christ you are the greatest man to\\never walk the face of this earth.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Yeager and Warfield have pleaded guilty to criminal assault and\\nare in prison, while the third guard, Shane Wright, 23, remained a\\nfugitive. The two imprisoned men were brought here for the trial\\nand testified that they were responsible for their actions, a point\\nrepeated by Steele.\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-09-08-00 0156EDT &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

He was 89 and lived in\\nMansura, La.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Oliver sued the Escude Funeral Home in Mansura, where he lived\\nall his life, for discrimination after it refused to provide\\nvisitation for his deceased mother, Martha Pierre Oliver, because\\nshe was black.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Lawyers from the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights\\norganization in Montgomery, Ala., advanced his case in federal\\ncourt, charging that the Escude Funeral Home and Hixson Brothers\\nFuneral Home in Avoyelles Parish either refused to deal with blacks\\nor offered ``distinctly inferior services'' for the same prices\\nthat they charged whites.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Oliver won his case.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Morris Dees, the chief trial counsel of the Southern Poverty Law\\nCenter and a member of the original team of lawyers that handled\\nthe case, said, ``Although the case was not binding, because it\\nnever reached the Supreme Court, it served notice to funeral homes,\\nand even cemeteries and other businesses, that if they practiced\\ndiscrimination against blacks they could be violating federal\\nlaw.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dees said that after the ruling was announced, his organization\\nheard reports from across the country that previously segregated\\nfuneral homes had begun to offer a full line of service to black\\nclients.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Nevertheless,'' he said, ``black funeral homes continue to\\nprosper in the South as a matter of choice.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Gaon Escude, a spokesman for the funeral home, said that his\\ngrandfather, who operated the home at the time of the lawsuit,\\nprovided all services, including embalming, but stopped at offering\\nvisitation to blacks ``because, if he did, he thought he'd lose\\nbusiness from whites.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   He added that his grandfather's competitors at the time would\\nnot accept any black clients at all.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Rev.

Dees, of the Montgomery,\\nAla.-based Southern Poverty Law Center, has said he hoped the\\npenalty would be severe enough to bankrupt the Aryan Nations.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The 82-year-old Butler spoke briefly outside the courtroom,\\ncomparing himself to some biblical figures and also declaring\\nnorthern Idaho a haven for racists.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''This is nothing,'' Butler said. ''We have planted seeds. Most\\nof north Idaho now is filled with the people who escaped\\nmulticulturalism or diversity or whatever you want to call it.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Jurors set $6 million as a punitive damage award, with $330,000\\nin compensatory damages to the Keenans, who were chased, shot at\\nand assaulted after they stopped to search for a dropped wallet\\nnear the entrance to the Aryan Nations' compound.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dees said he doesn't intend to allow the defendants to begin\\ndisposing of their assets.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''We intend to enforce this verdict.

''Without them, I don't think I could have\\ndone all this,'' she said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Edgar Steele, who represents Butler and the Aryan Nations, said\\nhe will move for a new trial.

Butler would have to\\npost a $9 million bond to appeal.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ''I consider this area to be one of the last bastions of free\\nspeech in America,'' Steele said. ''You can write the epitaph for\\nthat now.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The jury found Butler, the Aryan Nations and Saphire Inc. 90\\npercent negligent and liable for $4.8 million of the award.\\nButler's chief of staff, Michael Teague, was found 10 percent\\nnegligent and liable for $600,000.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The former guards Jesse Warfield and John Yeager -- who are\\nserving prison terms for the assaults on the Keenans -- were also\\nfound liable for punitive damages. Yeager was assessed $100,000 in\\npunitive damages and Warfield $500,000 in punitive damages.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The jury also awarded Victoria Keenan $250,000 and Jason Keenan\\n$80,000 in compensatory damages.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Steele blamed the two guards and argued Butler was not\\nresponsible. Steele said that Warfield and Yeager were drunk --\\nagainst regulations -- when they attacked the Keenans on the evening\\nof July 1, 1998.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Warfield and Yeager, who represented themselves, took\\nresponsibility for the attack, but steadfastly refusing to\\nimplicate Butler. They said they mistook a car backfire as gunfire\\nfrom the Keenans and perceived a threat.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Steele said Butler preaches nonviolence, except in self-defense.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler tried to distance himself from the actions of Warfield,\\nYeager and a third former guard, whom he called unpaid volunteers.\\nThe third former guard, Shane Wright, remains a fugitive.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Butler presides over the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which\\nholds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the\\noffspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are\\ninferior.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   His disciples have included some of the most notorious figures\\nin the white supremacist movement, such as Robert Mathews, who\\nfounded a neo-Nazi offshoot of the Aryan Nations, and Buford\\nFurrow, who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on charges of killing\\nan Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up a Jewish day care\\ncenter last summer.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a\\nsign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his\\nliterature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan\\nWorld Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100\\nacolytes.

This also is when the\\n``Organization'' eradicates liberalism, feminism and the other isms\\nof compassion.\\n &HT;    Amazingly, very few people besides scholars, terrorism experts\\nand, of course, white extremists have read ``The Turner Diaries.''\\nEven more shocking, at least to me, is that so few journalists have\\nread it.\\n &HT;    The following edited excerpts from the novel should give readers\\na glimpse of what our home-grown terrorists are reading for\\ninspiration:\\n &HT;    ``Liberalism is an essentially feminine, submissive world view.\\nPerhaps a better adjective than feminine is infantile. It is the\\nworld view of men who do not have the moral toughness, the\\nspiritual strength to stand up and do single combat with life, who\\ncannot adjust to the reality that the world is not a huge,\\npink-and-blue, padded nursery in which the lions lie down with the\\nlambs and everyone lives happily ever after.''\\n &HT;    ``One day we will have a truly American press in this country,\\nbut a lot of editors' throats will have to be cut first.''\\n &HT;    ```Women's lib' was a form of mass psychosis which broke out\\nduring the last three decades of the Old Era. Women affected by it\\ndenied their femininity and insisted that they were `people,' not\\n`women.'''\\n &HT;    ``There is no way a society based on Aryan values and an Aryan\\noutlook can evolve peacefully from a society which has succumbed to\\nJewish spiritual corruption.''\\n &HT;    ``The (Uncle) `Toms' will eventually get their more militant and\\nresentful brethren back into line, but meanwhile Izzy and Sambo are\\nreally at one another's throats, tooth and nail, and it is a joy to\\nbehold.''\\n &HT;    ``The hanging of a few of the worst race-criminals in every\\nneighborhood in America will help enormously in straightening out\\nthe majority of the population and reorienting their thinking. In\\nfact, it will not only help, but it is absolutely necessary. The\\npeople require a strong psychological shock to break old habits of\\nthought.''\\n &HT;    ``Talk of `innocents' has no meaning. We must look at our\\nsituation collectively, in a race-wide sense. We must understand\\nthat our race is like a cancer patient undergoing drastic surgery\\nin order to save his life. There is no sense in asking whether the\\ntissue being cut out is `innocent' or not. That is no more\\nreasonable than trying to distinguish the `good' Jews from the bad\\nones _ or, as some of our thicker-skulled `good ol' boys' still\\ninsist on trying, separating the `good niggers' from the rest of\\ntheir race.''\\n &HT;    ``We'll go to the uttermost ends of the earth to hunt down the\\nlast of Satan's spawn.''\\n &HT;    After the Organization conquers the world with nuclear weapons,\\nthe ``Great One'' hands down a final edict: ``It (is) no longer\\nsufficient to be merely white; in order to eat one (has) to be\\njudged the bearer of especially valuable genes.''\\n &HT;    After the Oklahoma City bombing, Pierce, aka Andrew Macdonald,\\nwho holds a doctorate in physics and is a former professor in\\nOregon, quipped that ``someone may have read` The Turner\\nDiaries.'''\\n &HT;    An understatement, for sure. As head of the Neo-Nazi National\\nAlliance, the biggest and most active of such groups nationwide,\\nPierce invites at least 100 members who possess what he calls\\n``leadership potential'' to a private workshop each year at the\\nHillboro, W.Va., headquarters. There, the future stalwarts, who\\nmistake paranoia for patriotism, are trained in the civilized art\\nof hatred.\\n &HT;    The main training manual? ``The Turner Diaries.'' Besides these\\n100 crazies who are required to read the book each year, many\\nothers, such as McVeigh, Smith and Furrow, discover it in their own\\nway and re-enact its graphic mayhem.\\n &HT;    -----\\n &HT;    (Bill Maxwell, African American, is an editorial writer and\\ncolumnist for the St. Petersburg Times in St. Petersburg, Fla.

       " 'summary': 'China, Cuba and the United States are countries trying to improve music and arts education in the public schools.  Despite disagreement as to the importance of this instruction to other aspects of the students\\' development, its value in its own right is accepted.  It is also generally agreed that much demands to be done.  In China music and drama weekends supplement the school curriculum, special schools train rural schoolteachers in music and the arts and schools are being equipped with necessary facilities for music and arts instruction.  In Cuba music education is emphasized but the instruments are old and in need of repair.  In the United States there is widespread recognition of damage done by 20-30 years of elimination or reduction of music and arts classes due to budget cuts or increased emphasis on core subjects to satisfy testing requirements.  Various approaches are being tried as remedies.  U.S. Secretary of Education Riley has said, \"...most American children are infrequently or never given serious instruction or performance opportunities in music, the arts or theater.  That\\'s wrong\".  Across the country efforts to compensate for cutbacks include: raising private funds; arranging assistance to the public schools from cultural, educational and non-profit organizations; development of digital techniques for music and the arts; offering free after-school and summer programs; introducing low-cost equipment; blending the arts and music into core subjects; and including music and arts as college admission requirements.

But he\\ndidn't have a clue about how to get from singing around the house\\nto the cover of a compact disc _ until Tuesday.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Taylor was one of 700 students from 21 metro high schools who\\ngot a crash course in how to break into the music business at\\nGrammy in the Schools, a daylong seminar sponsored by the Atlanta\\nchapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (the\\nfolks who bring us the Grammys).\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Students, chosen by teachers and counselors for their interest\\nin music, got to hear from some of the city's top industry\\ninsiders, such as producer Rico Wade (Outkast, Goodie Mob),\\nengineer Phil Tan (Usher, Mariah Carey, TLC, Jermaine Dupri) and\\nvideo producer Fred Taylor (``The Dip''). The hard-work message was\\nfairly consistent: ``You can't just buy a keyboard and make money;\\nyou may have to cut some grass,'' advised Wade. But panelists also\\nhelped students understand what the word business means when it\\ncomes to making music.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``A lot of times, all they see is the glamour side of the\\nbusiness, but they don't see all the work,'' said Charles Driebe,\\nan Atlanta entertainment lawyer.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   As students realized they were brushing shoulders with heavy\\nhitters, hands shot up throughout the Rialto Center for the\\nPerforming Arts.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``How do I copyright a song I've written?''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Why does a musician need an attorney?''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``I want to be a gospel singer, but how do I get started?''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Students also were able to attend sessions on songwriting,\\ncomposition, artist management, interactive media, entertainment\\nlaw, publishing and public relations.

Jack starts a two-way\\nconversation with her instead of issuing a series of ``I want'' or\\n``I need'' demands, she says. And both children are drawn to the\\nkitchen when Mayner turns on the classical music _ otherwise, she\\nsays, they tend to stay in their rooms.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But it's not just mood that Mayner, and many other parents, are\\nconcerned with. She is one of thousands of Americans who believe in\\nthe ``Mozart effect,'' a theory that classical music can affect the\\nlearning capabilities of children 3 and younger.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect\\non anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose\\nminds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of\\nCalifornia-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in\\nchild development, bringing with it several popular parenting books\\nand an onslaught of CDs _ all aimed at directing American parents\\ntoward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula\\nfor effective parenting.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or\\nhelpful?\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the\\ntheory behind the Mozart effect. The most well-known is Dr. John\\nBruer, president of St. Louis' McDonnell Foundation. In ``The Myth\\nof the First Three Years,'' which will be published Sept. 9 by Free\\nPress (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis\\nhas been placed on brain development in the first three years of\\nlife.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims\\nthat listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial\\nreasoning skills.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Kenneth Steele agrees. A psychology professor at North\\nCarolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart\\neffect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the\\nCalifornia studies don't hold up.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even\\ninclude young children _ they were performed on college students,\\nwho were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a\\nspecific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and\\ncutting a piece of paper. This is, he says, hardly a measure of any\\nsort of long-term brain developmental abilities.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there\\nwas virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects\\nwho listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern\\ncomposer Philip Glass.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were\\npublished in July in ``Psychological Science.'' ``These students\\nwere equivalent across the board; their performance was the same.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the\\nminority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical\\nCDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart.'' Three of the 15 top-selling\\nclassical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the\\nauthor whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon\\nhardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe\\nin the effect.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   On the national level, Florida toddlers now listen to classical\\nmusic in public schools _ by law. The National Academy of Recording\\nArts and Sciences handed out free CDs of classical Grammy winners\\nthis past spring.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.\\nCalifornian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical\\nmusic helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for\\ncomplex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of\\nclassical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep\\nWith Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide. ``I am\\nconvinced. I believe it.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as\\npeople's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.\\nThe whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to\\ndo something good for their children. Parents who play their kids\\nthe music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that\\nthey're helping their child's development.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too,\\nSteele says with a laugh. It all comes down to the money. Babies\\nwill always be born to proud, new parents who want to do what's\\nbest _ which means that classical albums for kids may be major cash\\ncows.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``There's a lot of commercial interest here,'' Steele says. ``A\\nlot of companies see it as a way to sell a lot of CDs very fast.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (Dave Ferman covers pop music for the Star-Telegram.

Times News Service    \\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   Never mind that Mozart's concertos strike peaceful chords in\\nmusic lovers. In academia, the battle lines are drawn, and the next\\nsalvo in the Mozart wars is about to be fired.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Researchers are mustering data to counter those who are intent\\non debunking the ``Mozart effect'' _ the theory that classical\\nmusic makes the brain work better _ and they have some high-profile\\nallies. President Clinton and the musician Billy Joel, for example,\\nspoke in June at a school in New York City's East Harlem that\\nreceived a donation of $5 million in musical instruments from VH1\\nSave the Music Foundation, in support of the notion that musical\\neducation can provide a powerful intellectual stimulus.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In May, Harold O. Levy, the chancellor of New York City's public\\nschools, surprised 43 school superintendents by arranging for them\\nto take a group violin lesson from Isaac Stern.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Music educators have long claimed that music, one of\\ncivilization's great gifts, bestows a bouquet of benefits upon\\nchildren. They say that music sharpens children's concentration and\\nmakes them brighter and livelier.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   If music's beauty and mystery fail to impress cost-conscious\\nschool boards, the thinking goes, then proving its ancillary\\nbenefits might save music programs from the budgetary ax wielded by\\nthose who regard music as an expensive luxury unrelated to reading,\\nwriting and `rithmetic.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   To help determine who is right, an array of scientists is\\nstudying how music works in the brain. The researchers have\\nanalyzed babies' responses to lullabies, as well as their awareness\\nof pitch and rhythm, showing, in some studies, that infants\\nexperience music much as adults do. We arrive ready to join the\\nband, the scientists say, but too often the instruments have been\\npacked away by schools that no longer use them.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   A report that will appear in the fall issue of the Journal of\\nAesthetic Education, published by the University of Illinois Press,\\nsuggests that those instruments should be hauled out and tuned up.\\nAccording to the report, written by Lois Hetland, a cognitive\\npsychologist at Project Zero, a research organization co-directed\\nby Howard Gardner at the Harvard Graduate School of Education,\\nsomething happens to young children when they are given keyboard\\nlessons for several months or years: while the instruction lasts,\\nand for up to two years afterward, the children's performance on\\nspatial reasoning tests improves.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   That observation was the genesis of the term ``Mozart effect,''\\nwhich has been trademarked by the musician and author Don Campbell,\\nalthough his new book, ``The Mozart Effect For Children,'' to be\\npublished in September by William Morrow, is unrelated to the study\\nthat started the debate.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In the original 1993 study, Gordon L. Shaw and Frances H.\\nRauscher showed that a small group of college students performed\\nbetter on certain spatial-reasoning tests after listening to a\\nMozart sonata. The so-called ``effect'' _ an increased ability to\\n``see'' the design of a snowflake, for example, after mentally\\ncutting and folding a piece of paper, or to rotate and compare\\nobjects conceptually in space _ lasted only 10 to 15 minutes, but\\nthe news was treated like a formula to get smart quick.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Classical music seemed like the latest mega-vitamin: a little\\nhard to swallow, but so good for you. The theory, which made the\\nrounds of magazines in cover stories, quickly found its biggest\\naudience in the conscientious parents of young children and to the\\nparents of children-to-be, who hurried to buy specially packaged\\nmusic CDs so they could play Pachelbel's Canon to their babies in\\nutero.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In Georgia, no purchase was necessary for newborns. Gov. Zell\\nMiller, citing the Mozart effect, proposed in 1998 providing the\\nparents of every Georgia newborn with a classical music cassette or\\ncompact disc. Sony produced the albums free, and they were included\\nin gift packets at hospitals. The Mozart data was absorbed into\\ncurrent views of cognitive development, and parents rushed to\\nimprove those new brains.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Some neuroscientists, however, cringed at the simplistic\\nscenario. So did Rauscher, who cautioned against distorting her\\nteam's modest findings. The Mozart hype, especially in relation to\\ninfants, was ripe for puncturing, and Dr. John Bruer obliged in his\\nbook, ``The Myth of the First Three Years,'' published last fall by\\nFree Press. Bruer, president of the McDonnell Foundation in St.\\nLouis, which finances research in neuroscience and cognition,\\nargued that no one need rush to program music or anything else into\\nbabies' brains. The brain, he reassured parents, was most likely\\nmalleable for life.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Hetland, whose work addresses college students as well as\\npreschool and elementary-school children, conducted two\\ncomprehensive analyses of all the known studies of the subject as\\npart of Project Zero's Reviewing Education in the Arts Project,\\nwhich she served as manager.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In the first analysis, more than 2,000 college students\\nparticipating in 31 studies listened to several different kinds of\\nmusic, as well as to silence and to a vocal-relaxation tape. They\\nscored higher on spatial-reasoning tests after they heard Mozart,\\nSchubert and Mendelssohn than under any other conditions, including\\nlistening to music by Philip Glass, Pearl Jam and other rock\\ngroups. Music with a complex structure and rhythm won out over\\nrepetitious, more predictable music, Hetland said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Advocates of music in the schools say that it is good, but not\\nenough, to sit children in an auditorium and present them with a\\nwell-played rendition of ``Peter and the Wolf.'' For children to\\nbenefit most, they need to make music themselves, those advocates\\nsay.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Indeed, Hetland's second analysis showed that. It involved 700\\npreschool and elementary school children who participated in 15\\ndifferent studies. Some children received weekly 15-minute periods\\nof active music instruction, both individually and in groups. They\\nlistened to music and moved to its rhythms, played percussion\\ninstruments like triangles, rhythm sticks and cymbals, sang and\\ntook piano lessons. The control groups received either passive\\nmusic instruction, computerized reading and arithmetic instruction\\nor no special instruction.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   nn\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   &QL;\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The gap between the before-and-after scores on spatial-reasoning\\ntests of the children who received active music instruction was\\nmuch greater than the gaps in the scores of the children in the\\ncontrol groups, Hetland said. She defined spatial skill as the\\nability to conceive of and understand the placement of objects and\\nimages in two- or three-dimensional space. The test scores of\\nchildren who learned to read notes on a musical staff jumped\\nhighest of all.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``This does give music education advocates a lobbying tool, if\\nthey want to justify a music program,'' Hetland said. Surgeons,\\nengineers and archaeologists need spatial skills. So do artists and\\nchess players. ``Spatial instruction is a great way to teach\\nmath,'' she said. ``If you can enhance people's spatial ability\\nthrough a program of music instruction, we're not sure why, but\\nmost kids would benefit.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   That lack of an explanation for the demonstrated benefit of\\nmusic instruction keeps controversy bubbling in the overlapping\\nfields of cognitive science and early-childhood education. Does\\nmusic per se improve mental gymnastics? Or is the spatial-reasoning\\neffect a result of something else _ the spatial patterns made by\\nthe black and white keys on the keyboard, perhaps, or a factor like\\nchange of mood after participating in music?\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dr. E. Glenn Schellenberg, an associate professor of psychology\\nat the University of Toronto, is skeptical about the Project Zero\\nreport. ``Just because there's an association doesn't mean it's\\ncausal,'' he said. ``They've got to show that the effect is\\nspecific to music. The right experiment has not been done.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schellenberg has a $150,000 grant from the International\\nFoundation for Music Research in San Diego to give 36 weeks of free\\narts lessons to 6-year-olds, beginning in September, randomly\\nassigning groups of children to keyboard, voice or drama classes.\\n``We'll be looking to see whether the two music groups show greater\\nlevels of improvement on before-and-after-tests than the drama\\ngroups,'' he said, ``and whether the two music groups differ.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Who knows,'' he added, ``music could be special.''\\n</P>\\n<ANNOTATION>\\n   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)\\n</ANNOTATION>\\n<P>\\n   But some music teachers are impatient with the plodding\\nscientific approach. ``I don't need proof,'' said Lisha Papert\\nLercari, director of the Music and the Brain Project of the 42nd\\nStreet Development Fund in Manhattan, which has developed a\\nkeyboard program that is now being taught in 23 schools ``The kids\\nare discovering form and patterns, and noticing things we never\\nsaw.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   She said the keyboard training, which involves reading music,\\nalso helped immigrant Hispanic children in Queens pick up English\\nunusually fast, a language effect she expects to document in a\\nnearly completed study.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Educators like Lercari regard Rauscher, one of the original\\nMozart-effect researchers, as their spokeswoman. Not surprisingly,\\nRauscher was elated by the advance news of Hetland's report. ``I\\nthink that to ignore these findings is really to do a disservice to\\nthe children who can benefit most from them, especially\\ndisadvantaged children,'' Rauscher said. ``These are kids whose\\nparents can't afford the time or the money to take them to piano\\nlessons. They really rely on the public schools for this, and a\\nprekindergarten program would be the ideal place to start.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Rauscher, a former concert cellist who is now an assistant\\nprofessor of cognitive development at the University of Wisconsin\\nat Oshkosh, has conducted her own research since 1993 and\\nconsistently found higher spatial-reasoning scores correlating with\\nkeyboard and xylophone instruction for elementary school children.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Singing also has its place in the new emphasis on musicmaking.\\nIn White Plains, N.Y., which was recently named one of the top 10\\ncommunities in the country for music education in a survey\\nconducted by the American Music Conference, the National\\nAssociation for Music Education, the Music Teachers National\\nAssociation and the National School Boards Association, singing is\\nbeing integrated into prekindergarten and kindergarten classrooms.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Teresa Niss, coordinator of fine arts programs in the White\\nPlains schools, said that if kindergarten children are learning\\nabout the letter ``S,'' for example, they may sing songs about\\nsnakes and starfish. Musical counts help illustrate groups of\\nnumbers, while songs sung in connection with pictures facilitate\\nreading.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``We have seen changes in children's language development faster\\nthan we normally would,'' she said. The district is 35 percent\\nHispanic, and like Lercari, Niss said that Hispanic children\\narriving in school without knowledge of English ``are acquiring the\\nlanguage more quickly'' after their exposure to the music program.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   With a $100,000 three-year grant, provided by Texaco and the\\nEastman School of Music through their Partnership Opportunities\\nprogram, the district recently extended its program to\\nprekindergarten students and brought Linda P. Neelly, an\\nearly-childhood music consultant in Rochester, into the lower\\ngrades to work with music teachers and classroom teachers.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   One recent morning, Neelly gathered kindergarten students in a\\ncircle and asked them to take turns singing their names as she beat\\nthe rhythm on a tambourine. Then, in a clear and melodious voice,\\nshe repeated what each child had sung, enticing the children into a\\nmusical conversation as they drew or worked on group activities.\\nWhen groups of children drifted over to a xylophone on the floor,\\nshe used it to make up songs with them.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The class illustrated Neelly's view that music should flow\\nnaturally throughout the school day, much as the arts are taught\\n``through the curriculum'' in some middle and high schools.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   For this to happen, classroom teachers must also become\\nmusicmakers, and part of Neelly's job was to show them how. For\\nexample, one technique was to ask the teachers to sing in a higher\\nkey than normal so that children could replicate the sound.\\n``Children will sing in tune if they sing higher,'' Niss said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   All the musical failures critics portray seemed to fall on the\\nsmall shoulders of Aifa, who was silent when it was her turn to\\nsing her name in a White Plains classroom. ``I don't know how to\\nsing,'' she said, crestfallen. Neelly moved on to the next child,\\nbut when the group sang together later, Aifa joined in. No longer\\nin the spotlight, she found her natural voice, which, music\\nadvocates say, is like finding herself.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Every child has innate musical capacity,'' Neelly said. ``If\\nwe're not tapping in and finding ways to develop that ability,\\nwe're not doing our job as educators.''\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-08-02-00 1723EDT &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

Times News Service    \\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   NEW YORK _ After a long morning of drills in reading,\\nthird-graders at Public School 156 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, spent\\nan hour last Friday dancing to the urgent flutter of flamenco\\nmusic. Their small hands spiraled and their sneakers thumped as a\\nprofessional dancer, Andrea Del Conte, guided them through stomps\\nand whirls in a classroom with mirrored walls and glossy floors.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Dance is an indispensable part of the curriculum for all 750\\nstudents at Public School 156, along with music, art and creative\\nwriting. Poems paper the school walls, parents sew costumes for\\nspecial dance performances, and teachers gamely join students in\\ndaily artistic experiments linked to the subjects they are\\nstudying. Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and\\nlanguage arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The school has developed a comprehensive arts program in\\npartnership with several of New York City's nonprofit cultural\\ninstitutions whose employees have advised the teachers, helped\\nwrite the curriculum and frequently visited the classrooms to teach\\nstudents about different art forms.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   For the last two decades, schools like Public School 156 have\\nincreasingly turned to the city's museums, concert halls and\\ntheaters for lessons in art, music and dance. They began to do so\\nin the 1970s, when the city's near-bankruptcy eliminated hundreds\\nof arts instructors. Now, cultural institutions as large as the New\\nYork Philharmonic and as small as neighborhood dance troupes have\\nbecome a permanent part of the city's educational landscape.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Even though the city is investing in arts education again, the\\ninstitutions are playing a greater role than ever, not just giving\\noccasional performances or tours as they once did, but helping\\nschools retool their curriculums to integrate art, music and dance\\ninto every academic subject.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The institutions are involved not just to improve arts\\neducation, but out of self-interest: They want to cultivate future\\naudiences and impress potential donors at a time when improving\\npublic education is considered an especially pressing and honorable\\ncause.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Carnegie Hall spends close to $1 million a year training\\nteachers to use music in the classroom, putting on concerts for\\nschool children and sending musicians to 22 schools across the city\\nfor seven visits per class over a school year. The Roundabout\\nTheater sends teaching artists to 40 classrooms in the city for 10\\nvisits each. Those artists teach students about reading, writing,\\ndirecting and acting in plays as part of their language arts and\\nsocial studies curriculums.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Artists from Lotus Music and Dance Studios in Chelsea work\\nintensively with six schools across the city, including Public\\nSchool 156, teaching students about the music and dance of\\ndifferent cultures.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The enthusiasm for such programs is striking at a time when city\\nschools are under intense pressure to prepare students for\\nincreasingly rigorous standardized tests. While Mayor Rudolph W.\\nGiuliani and Chancellor Rudy Crew have goaded schools to focus on\\nreading and math, they have also increased the arts education\\nbudget by $150 million since 1997, providing about 1,000 art and\\nmusic teachers and supplies for the city's 1,100 public schools.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   That investment is not enough to bring the arts into every\\nclassroom, but in this flush economy, private foundations are\\njoining cultural institutions in spending money on arts education\\npartnerships. Most notably, the philanthropist Walter Annenberg\\npledged $12 million to New York City schools in 1993 for academic\\nofferings in the arts in a matching-fund program that is to total\\n$36 million. So far, 81 schools have received grants, most of them\\n$75,000 a year, to develop programs with nonprofit institutions.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (OPTIONAL TRIM)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``The question now is not whether to teach the arts, but how to\\nput them at the core of everything a school does,'' said Hollis\\nHeadrick, executive director of the Center for Arts Education,\\nwhich oversees the Annenberg partnerships.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Even with the infusion of money and the enthusiasm of cultural\\ninstitutions, progress in arts education is slow. Some institutions\\nreport tensions with teachers who say the programs occupy too much\\ntime. So far, only the most motivated schools are truly integrating\\nthe arts into their curriculums, a process that requires extra work\\nand money and a willingness to drastically change teaching methods.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   This week, educators from 40 countries are discussing how to\\nspeed the progress at the International Conference on the Future of\\nArts Education, sponsored by the New York International Festival of\\nthe Arts, at IBM's conference site in Palisades, N.Y.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``We still need to teach the basic skills, but students today\\nneed an education that recognizes a much wider range of\\nintellectual abilities and ways of communicating,'' said Ken\\nRobinson, co-chairman of the conference and a professor of arts\\neducation at the University of Warwick in England.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Most arts organizations charge schools a fee for their\\nexpertise, ranging from a few dollars per student for a single\\nlecture or performance to upward of $50,000 for ongoing classroom\\nvisits and teacher training by several teaching artists.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``It takes so much extra work to start something like this,''\\nsaid Verano LaRue, the arts education specialist at Lotus Music and\\nDance Studios, which Public School 156 is paying about $40,000 this\\nyear to incorporate dance into the school's curriculum.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At Public School 156 last week, the principal, Martha\\nRodriguez-Torres, nodded approvingly at a teacher and an aide who\\nwere learning steps with the young flamenco dancers, then walked\\ndown the hall to offer encouragement to fifth graders writing poems\\nabout things that comfort them _ part of a project on Native\\nAmericans that uses the help of another cultural group, Teachers\\nand Writers Collaborative.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Come on, Dennis, let the ideas flow through you!'' she told a\\nboy who had put down his pencil after writing one line. She clapped\\nloudly when another student read a poem that began, ``Oh dresser\\ndrawer, you smell so good with your aroma of fried chicken.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said that reading and math scores at Public\\nSchool 156, while still relatively low, have improved since the\\nschool won an Annenberg grant two years ago.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Our reading scores have improved every year, and I can say\\nthat our children now enjoy writing,'' Ms. Rodriguez-Torres said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But even schools whose principals and teachers highly value the\\narts may have to work hard to convince parents and even students\\nthat they are as important an academic subject as math, reading and\\nscience. After ebulliently whirling to the flamenco music last\\nweek, Katherine Nevarez, a third grader, solemnly said that while\\nthe rhythms lingered in her mind all day, dancing was not her\\nfavorite subject.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``When we do it, it's fun,'' she said. ``But my uncle told me\\nthat if I study math I'll get a college degree.''\\n(MORE) nn\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they\\nvalue math is to measure student progress with traditional\\nassessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by\\nintroducing standards that outline what students should learn\\nthrough arts instruction. But Terry L. Baker, an education\\nconsultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the\\nAnnenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess\\na student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual''\\nsubjects as music and painting.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be\\nheld accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he\\nsaid. ``But we are still some distance from figuring out the best\\nway to do that.''\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-11-10-99 0007EST &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

Most had participated in Carnegie Hall's Linkup music\\neducation program, and it showed.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Linkup was developed in the 1980s when arts programs were being\\nslashed in New York City public schools and elsewhere around the\\ncountry. But how much the students actually learned was measured\\nlargely through anecdotes until now.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Carnegie Hall tried to improve on this with help from Columbia\\nUniversity's Teachers College and Educational Testing Services.\\nProgram administrators asked 6,000 students participating in the\\nprogram to develop musical compositions at the beginning of the\\ncourse and again at the end. The students used commercially\\navailable glockenspiels and homemade thumb pianos, guitars made of\\ncardboard, a set of three can drums, can shakers and trumpets made\\nfrom garden hoses.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Using a complicated scoring formula, testers evaluated the\\ndifferences between the two compositions. The improvement was far\\nfrom earthshaking, but evaluators concluded that it was\\n``significant'' given the modest length of the program, which ran\\nfor seven 45-minute sessions. The final compositions showed small\\nimprovements in how students produced sounds and alternated\\ninstruments.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   And in written responses to questions about composing, the\\nstudents gave more detailed explanations of how they used the\\ninstruments to create action, character and mood.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Results of the study were released this month. ``I was very\\npleased with the modest gains,''said Carol Myford, a senior\\nresearch scientist at Educational Testing Services in Princeton,\\nN.J. ``This is a short-term program.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Linkup emphasizes basic music concepts and music's relationships\\nto other academic subjects through classes, planning sessions for\\nteachers and artists, and concerts in schools and neighborhoods.\\nThis year, the 14-year-old program involved 22,000 students and 733\\nteachers at 176 schools in New York.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   For the study, conducted in the 1996-97 school year, students\\nworking in groups of six were given a set of instruments and asked\\nto write a piece of music that would illustrate a short story they\\nwere asked to read. Then they were asked, after some instruction in\\nhow to use the instruments, to choose sounds that ``show''\\ncharacters, action and mood.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The students had 15 minutes to create and practice a piece that\\nwas a minute or two long. Each group played its piece, which was\\nrecorded.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The exercise was repeated at the end of the program, and the\\ncompositions were taped again. The students' efforts were evaluated\\nfor use of timbre, texture, portrayal of the text and overall\\neffectiveness. The students also responded to written questions on\\nwork sheets.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The study found that sixth graders made the greatest gains while\\nfourth graders made the smallest. The report hypothesized that\\nolder students had had more exposure to the concepts of text,\\ntimbre and texture. Another hypothesis was that the curriculum was\\nmore appropriate for older students.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Overall, students showed the most improvement in their use of\\ntexture and the smallest gain in their exploration of timbre.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Howard Gardner, a professor of cognition and education at the\\nHarvard University Graduate School of Education, whose theories of\\nmultiple intelligences have gained wide popularity, said that the\\nstudy sounded like a positive step but that follow-up was needed.\\nIt is important to determine whether the students continue to\\nimprove, after such a short program, and at what rate, Gardner\\nsaid.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``That you can do something in a short time is worth noting,''\\nhe added. ``It's a good message to kids that this is something you\\ncan get better at.''\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-06-29-99 1708EDT &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

Some say they might drop\\nout if not for the arts programs.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Those students are riding a national wave of encouragement that\\nhas spurred the growth of programs like the Blue Springs Academy.\\nAlso fueling the movement, recent brain research shows that some\\nchildren learn in ways other than the traditional three R's.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In Missouri, fine-arts academies for middle and high school\\nstudents have sprouted in the past four years in Springfield,\\nIndependence and Blue Springs. In the Kansas City district, magnet\\nprograms for the arts are highly popular.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Educators in Kansas said more money is going to train teachers\\nto expand music, theater and visual-arts programs by using existing\\nart in the community. And teachers are being taught to blend the\\narts into core subjects such as English, science, history and math.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``We are looking at meeting the needs of all students, the\\nacademically proficient and the artistically gifted,'' said Dee\\nHansen, fine-arts specialist at the Kansas Department of Education.\\n``The more we learn about how we learn, the more it validates fine\\narts as an integral part of the curriculum.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In Missouri, arts academies are funded like other summer\\nprograms _ through state reimbursement for attendance. Also,\\nphilanthropic foundations contribute toward field trips and\\nequipment.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Blue Springs Academy, in its first year, receives support\\nfrom the Truman Heartland Community Foundation and offers theater,\\nvisual arts, vocal instruction, videography and creative writing.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   About 55 students attend the academy, which was modeled after\\nthe nationally recognized George Caleb Bingham Fine Arts Academy in\\nthe Independence district.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Bingham Academy, in its third year, offers a five-week\\nprogram for five disciplines: creative writing, dance, instrumental\\nand vocal music, theater and visual arts.

Fortunately, a slew of new online and off-line\\narts-education resources has arrived to help alleviate the latest\\nslice of bad news.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The current generation of schoolchildren is close to being\\narts-illiterate, according to a recent study by the National Center\\nfor Education Statistics. The survey of eighth graders found that\\nfewer than one in four attend schools where dance or theater is\\noffered, and only 25 percent could pick out a Cubist work from\\namong four paintings. (The nation seems to be training a population\\nof bad guessers, too.)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley said the study\\n``verifies that most American children are infrequently or never\\ngiven serious instruction or performance opportunities in music,\\nthe arts or theater. That's wrong.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   What's right is that an increasing number of educators are using\\ntechnology to interest children in the arts, just as their\\ncolleagues continue to strive to use computers to teach the basics\\nof reading, writing and 'rithmetic.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Massachusetts Institute of Technology said last week that it\\nwould spend $27 million to add a new children's center to its famed\\nMedia Laboratory. Areas of research will include new digital\\ntechniques for music, dance, storytelling and the visual arts.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Arts education is important, and technology will be an essential\\nelement in that educational process, said Mitchel Resnick, an\\nassociate professor at MIT who is involved in planning for the\\nchildren's center.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``A lot of the richest learning experiences come when people are\\ninvolved in designing, creating and expressing, and generally there\\naren't enough of those experiences in the lives of children,'' he\\nsaid. ``The children of today, who have become very fluent with new\\ntechnologies, are actually more poised to become expressive with\\nthose technologies than previous generations.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Resnick continued: ``If all you have is modeling clay and finger\\npaints, you can express yourself in some ways, but it's limited. We\\nwant to make digital technologies that are extensions of modeling\\nclay and finger paints, that provide a wider range of\\nexpressiveness.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At least one intriguing program is already under development at\\nMIT: the composer Tod Machover is creating a Toy Symphony that will\\nallow children to perform on newly designed electronic instruments\\nsuch as the ``squeeze tuba'' and the ``musical bug jar.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The MIT children's center is scheduled to open in 2003, but two\\nother high-tech learning centers devoted to the arts have already\\nopened their doors.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The new Zeum, an art and technology center for children that\\nopened on Oct. 31 in San Francisco, has an airy gallery for\\ninteractive art. Those who ascend the 34,000-square-foot\\nstructure's Guggenheim-inspired spiral ramp -- a skateboarder's\\ndream -- will discover a digital production studio that gives a\\ncrew of children 30 minutes to assemble a short video, using\\nvisuals, sounds and graphics of their own devising. Ultimately, the\\nvideos will be sent out over the Web; at the moment, an archive of\\nrecent creations can be accessed.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The idea of making a video might seem a bit dated, but Sheila\\nBergman, Zeum director, said, ``We're planting a seed here,'' and\\nindicated that future programs will be more digitally focused.\\nAlready, the arts center is leading Web-authoring sessions for\\nteens.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In September, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra unveiled ECHO, an\\ninteractive music-learning center nestled in the ensemble's\\nextensively renovated performance complex. In the A-Musing Room,\\nyoung visitors plug their hand-held ``instrument boxes'' into a\\ncomputer system that introduces them to such musical basics as\\nrhythm and pitch.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Many new digital arts-education resources can be experienced at\\nhome. The composer Morton Subotnick has just premiered ``Making\\nMore Music,'' a CD-ROM that provides more advanced exercises than\\nthe fundamentals found in its highly regarded predecessor, ``Making\\nMusic.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   At the disk's core are two areas, ``Rhythm Band'' and ``Chamber\\nMusic,'' that enable aspiring composers to draw marks on a page of\\non-screen sheet music. The marks can then be converted into\\nstandard musical notation and, more important, audible sounds.\\nHearing them produces a magic moment akin to watching a page of\\nphotographic paper bloom into an image in the darkroom. The disk's\\ngraphic design is dorky, but this and other quibbles are quickly\\novercome by the sonic results, which mostly sound pretty good, even\\nwhen a string of random marks is drawn on the score.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Web is also acting as a canvas for several noteworthy\\narts-education ventures. ArtsConnectEd, a joint project of the\\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts and its neighbor, the\\never-progressive Walker Arts Center, was quietly launched last\\nmonth and is still in its early stages in terms of supplying\\nteachers with lesson plans and other valuable tools.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   But there is already much fun to be had. The student-activities\\nsection of the ``For Your Classroom'' area has a toy chest's worth\\nof interactive, art-themed games that range from the rudimentary\\n(``Color Your Cabin'') to the highly sophisticated\\n(``Private/Public Space,'' a tutorial in contemporary sculpture).\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``People don't always know they're interested in the (art)\\nobject,'' said Kathy Halbreich, the Walker's director. ``One of the\\nthings that ArtsConnectEd begins to do is tie the object into a\\nvariety of life experiences. There's so many stories there, there's\\nso many opportunities to be charmed by discovery.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Museum of Modern Art in New York has a smaller-scale but\\nsimilar program in the works. ``Art Safari,'' scheduled to be\\nlaunched Dec. 12, will provide interactive exercises like a\\nJava-enabled area for making collages. However, a recent addition\\nto the ``Exhibitions'' area of the MOMA site is likely to appeal\\nmostly to adults: an animated how-to that supplements the museum's\\ndisplay of Joan Miro's ``Black and Red Series'' etchings.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Behind each of these high-tech teaching tools, there is an\\neducational vision. And that, said MIT's Resnick, is perhaps the\\nmost essential element of all.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Just the fact of getting a lot of technology out there will\\nnot necessarily do anything for the arts,'' he said. ``In fact,\\nwithout active effort, it won't be productive at all. You can put\\nall the finger paints in the world out there in kindergarten, and\\nthat's not necessarily going to lead to great artists.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   -------\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   RELATED SITES: (each address preceeded by http://www.)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   -------\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``Arts Report Card'': nces.ed.gov/naep/report97/1999486.shtml\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   -----\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (Matthew Mirapaul is a Chicago-based free-lance writer.)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   -----\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Copyright 1998 The New York Times Co.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   (To publish this article, call a New York Times Syndicate sales\\nrepresentative, Bob Farnell, Olivia Vasquez or Connie White, at\\n(888) 2-NYTSYN (888-269-8796).\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-12-03-98 1545EST &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

(bl)  \\n By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   \\n c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    \\n<TEXT>\\n<P>\\n   There is a national consensus that students need more competency\\nin reading, math, science and history. But Americans also want\\nschools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity.\\nWhen people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do\\nthey unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers\\ninevitably emphasize more easily testable skills. Less easily\\ntested ones get shorter shrift. For example, it is simpler to test\\nvocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may\\ndilute literacy, not enhance it.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic\\ncompetencies. The public once trusted teachers and administrators\\nto find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and\\nother activities. They may not always have gotten it right, but\\ntoday's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good\\nbalance either. If basic skills were undervalued before, they are\\nprobably overemphasized now.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives. Teachers\\nmust decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop\\ncitizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice.\\nTeachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to\\nschedule the elections.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas. Consider the\\nAcademy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly\\npoor and minority students. It may be closed if scores do not\\nimprove, so it now requires extra drills in basics. To find time,\\nteachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social\\nissues.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth. It\\nhas doubled math and English requirements for half its\\nninth-graders because they cannot graduate without passing state\\nexams. To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an\\nelective, like fine arts or gym.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   And in the affluent Washington suburb of Waterford, Va., an\\nelementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans\\nfor environmental studies because these cannot increase passing\\nrates on statewide exams.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Certainly, the current math and science focus is working. More\\nhigh schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and\\nphysics. Test scores are rising. But more teenagers have fatty\\ndiets; physical education enrollment has plummeted. Adolescent\\nobesity has soared. Neither children nor our economy will prosper\\nif graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor\\nexercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior. Should\\nCharlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education\\ninstead?\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills. But\\npressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative,\\nproject-based learning because teamwork is not measured on\\nstandardized exams.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation,\\nnot violence. But there is no standardized test for tolerance.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly\\naccountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do\\nmore. A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public\\nwanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to ``take\\nresponsibility.'' Only 39 percent say it should be academics. The\\nrest think teaching cooperation should have priority.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In 1994, Congress set national education goals _ being ``first''\\nin math and science was one, but others included preparing youth\\nfor responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community\\nservice), ensuring that students ``are healthy and fit'' and having\\nthem ``appreciate the nation's diverse heritage.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps\\nAmericans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if\\nthat is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote.\\nPerhaps not. The public cannot debate these choices if schools are\\naccountable only for basic skills results.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Standardized tests have improved many American schools.\\nNonetheless, society pays a price for this progress. If Americans\\ndo not equally demand accountability for less easily measured\\noutcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public\\neducation.\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-11-23-99 2148EST &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\",\n",

In a press conference\\nTuesday morning he plans to earn the title, unveiling a series of\\nproposals to revitalize the city's now creaky commitment to the\\narts.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Among his proposals will be a new director for the Seattle Arts\\nCommission. Present director Wendy Ceccherelli is moving to a newly\\ncreated job of chief arts strategist for the Seattle Parks\\nDepartment, focusing on the arts uses for the 151-acres of\\nSandpoint Park, now being developed as an addition to Magnuson Park\\non Sandpoint Way N.E. The new space could house low-cost artist\\nstudios as well as performing arts spaces.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schell will ask the city council for an additional $250,000 for\\narts from the general fund of next year's budget and increase the\\nOne Percent for Art attached to city construction projects to 1.5\\nPercent for Art.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In effect, he said, he's doubling the Percent for Arts Program,\\nbecause he's going to extend the Percent for Arts Program to\\nutilities such as the water and drainage systems located outside\\nbut owned by the city. The additional money will go not just to\\nvisual artists' projects but to projects in a range of disciplines.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The $250,000 will help implement the mayor's small, concrete\\nproposals to help bring the arts to the city's citizens. He has a\\nnew slogan he'll try out Tuesday: ``Arts Every Day for Everybody.''\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   These ideas include making Sandpoint available for smaller\\nperformance arts groups for specific dates, renovating the 600-seat\\ntheater on the site.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   On the fourth floor of Seattle Center's Center House will be\\nwhat the major calls a ``black box'' room or theater space also\\navailable to arts groups seeking performance venues. Such groups\\nwill also be able to book dates at the Museum of History and\\nIndustry and the Langston Hughes Cultural Arts Center.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   The Bathhouse Theater at Green Lake will reopen for multiple\\narts uses, and an study will identity the economic gain provided to\\nthe city by individual artists and small arts groups, similar to\\nthe one the Allen Foundation funded last year through the Corporate\\nCouncil for the Arts to study the economic impact of larger arts\\ngroups.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schell also has big ideas for high tech arts access, hiring a\\nso-called web-master to link arts groups with the schools and\\nempower neighborhoods to continue to create their own arts\\nidentities. The Seattle Public Library system will serve as focal\\npoint for information about the city's arts programs.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schell's proposals come in response to the recommendations of\\nthe Seattle Arts Task Force Report delivered to the mayor in June.\\nThe 21 artists, arts administrators and community activists who\\nmade up the the task force were chosen by Schell and City Council\\nmember Nick Licata nine months ago.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Although Schell's proposals fall short financially of the task\\nforce's recommendations, task force members contacted Monday were\\npleased by the mayor's annoucements.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Licata, who was out of town, issued a statement saying he was\\nheartened by the mayor's proposals and he views them as a crucial\\nfirst step.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Last June, saying that without adequate funding, the arts can't\\nflourish, the task force asked the city to establish a $200 million\\npublic endowment for the arts, raising roughly $15.5 million per\\nyear for 10 years, eventually going to fund the Seattle Arts\\nCommission. In the meantime, the task force recommended that the\\ncity set side 1 percent of the general fund to support the arts\\ncommission, and that the commission become a city department: the\\ncity's centralized art source.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Schell plans to study and refine the $200 million idea but nixed\\nthe other two suggestions, saying the general fund's support for\\nthe arts is already more than 1 percent, closer to 1.5 percent, but\\nit's spread over a variety of city agencies instead of centralized\\nin the arts commission.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   He's against centralization, as it turns out, preferring to\\ncontinue to distribute arts funding not only through the commission\\nbut through community parks, libraries, community centers and the\\nNeighborhood Matching Funds.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Centralizing information about the arts is another matter.\\nSchell wants the libraries to eliminate all red tape and give\\ncitizens specifics about the arts in a clean and direct fashion.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Jodee Fenton, library coordinator for fine and performing arts,\\nsays the library is already providing art access information, but\\nnot enough people know about it.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``We can do the best job on face of the earth, if nobody knows\\nabout it, what difference does it make?'' she said.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Currently, the library provides music listening stations, a\\npiano for practice, and a large collection of scores and recordings\\nfor public use, as well as an arts information line, 206-386-4612.\\nArts information is also available through the library online:\\nspl.org.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   In the future, the mayor wants the library to provide exhibition\\nspaces in neighborhood libraries for neighborhood artists; a music\\nensemble/theater arts room to try out new work, with video\\nequipment available as needed.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Another information source will be a revitalized ``Seattle\\nArts'' program on TVSEA, showcasing the Seattle Arts\\nCommission-funded artists and arts organizations.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   Besides the possibility of studios for artists at Sandpoint,\\nSchell is hosting a live/work forum for artists on Oct. 29. (For\\nmore information, call Amy Painter at the Seattle Arts Commision,\\n206-684-7306.)\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   On Monday, artist and task force member Barbara Thomas said that\\nhowever modest people may think the mayor's prospals are, they are\\nspecific.\\n</P>\\n<P>\\n   ``They give us a map of what he's thinking,'' she said. ``The\\ncity's commitment to arts was stalled. The mayor is laying out\\nwhere he plans to make his mark. Some of his ideas are quite bold,\\nlike the increasing the One Percent for Arts.''\\n</P>\\n</TEXT>\\n</BODY>\\n<TRAILER>\\nNYT-08-23-99 2042EDT &QL; \\n</TRAILER>\\n</DOC>\\n\"]}"
